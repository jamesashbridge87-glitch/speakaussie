## Phase 1: Owned Audience Research (Highest Priority)

### 1.1 Follower Survey
Deploy a short survey (5-7 questions) to Instagram and TikTok audience via:
- Instagram Stories poll sequence
- Link in bio to Google Form/Typeform
- TikTok video CTA

Questions to include:

- What's your current work situation? (Job hunting / New job / Established / Looking to advance)
- What's your biggest communication challenge at work? (Open text)
- Have you paid for English learning before? If so, what and how much?

- How much would you pay monthly? ($0 / $10 / $25 / $50+)

### 1.2 Comment Analysis
Export and analyze comments from top 20 performing TikTok and Instagram posts:
- Categorize by theme (pain points, questions, praise, requests)
- Extract exact language users use to describe problems
- Identify most-requested topics
- Note which videos generate "how do I..." or "I struggle with..." comments

### 1.3 DM/Message Review
Review direct messages received on both platforms:
- What questions do people ask?
- What help do they request?
- What situations do they describe?
- Any patterns by demographic or origin country?

### 1.4 Content Performance Deep-Dive

### 2.3 App Store & Search Research

## Current Assumptions to Validate

Based on initial social media data analysis:

### Audience Demographics (from Instagram/TikTok data)
- **Gender**: 52% Male, 47% Female
- **Peak Age**: 35-44 (46.4% combined)
- **Location**: 65% Australia, top sources: India, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam
- **Top Cities**: Sydney (20%), Melbourne (17%), Perth (5%), Brisbane (4.5%)

### Hypothesized Primary Audience
Skilled migrants already in Australia (or arriving soon) on work visas, seeking career advancement.

### Hypothesized Value Hierarchy
1. Career advancement (promotions, leadership roles) - highest economic value
2. Job mobility (interview success for better opportunities)
3. Social integration (belonging, not feeling like an outsider)

### Hypothesized Core Promise
"Your English is holding you back from the career you deserve in Australia."

**These assumptions require validation before committing to product direction.**
