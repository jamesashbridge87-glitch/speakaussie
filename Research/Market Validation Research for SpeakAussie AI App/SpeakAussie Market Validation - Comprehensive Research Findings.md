- **Net overseas migration**: 306,000 (2024-25), down 28% from 429,000
- **Temporary visa holders**: 363,000 (declining from 458,000)

#### International Students as Pipeline
- **Current international students**: 833,041 (October 2025)
- **New student arrivals**: 157,000 (2024-25, down from 204,000 in 2023-24)
- **University international students**: 495,652 (32.7% of total university enrollment)
- **Post-study work visa holders**: Primary pathway to skilled migration

#### Top Source Countries
1. China: 23% of international students
2. India: 17%
3. Nepal: 8%
4. Vietnam: 4%
5. Philippines: 4%

**Market Sizing Calculation**:
- Annual skilled migration intake: ~185,000
- International students converting to work visas: ~40-50% of 157,000 new arrivals = ~70,000
- **Total addressable market (annual)**: ~255,000 skilled migrants/international students
- **Addressable market (those needing workplace English)**: ~200,000-220,000 (excluding native English speakers)

### 1.2 Market Trends

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: The market is **contracting, not growing**
- International student arrivals down 23% year-on-year (204K → 157K)
- Net overseas migration down 28% year-on-year (429K → 306K)
- Temporary visa arrivals down 21% year-on-year (458K → 363K)
- However, government is reversing course: international student cap increasing from 270K to 295K in 2026

**Implication**: There's a **cyclical opportunity** - as student intake increases in 2026, demand for workplace English training will follow 12-18 months later.

### 1.3 Geographic Concentration

- Sydney: 20% of audience
- Melbourne: 17%
- Perth: 5%
- Brisbane: 4.5%

**Opportunity**: 65% of your current social media audience is already in Australia, suggesting strong product-market fit signals among those who've already arrived.

## 7. RISKS & REASONS THIS MIGHT FAIL

### 7.1 Market Risks

1. **Market Contraction**: International student intake down 23% YoY
   - Mitigation: Position for 2026 surge; build B2B channels now

2. **Competitor Response**: Duolingo/Babbel could easily add Australian content
   - Mitigation: Build community, focus on career positioning, not just content

3. **Pricing Sensitivity**: Migrants may be price-sensitive (already spending on visas, housing)
   - Mitigation: Freemium model with strong free tier

### 7.2 Product Risks

1. **Content Commoditization**: Australian slang/accent content is easy to copy
   - Mitigation: Focus on community, personalization, career outcomes

2. **Motivation Mismatch**: If you build for career advancement but audience wants confidence
   - Mitigation: Reframe messaging immediately; test with audience

3. **Accent Training Quality**: Accent coaching is hard to do well at scale
   - Mitigation: Partner with accent coaches; use AI carefully

### 7.3 Business Model Risks

1. **B2B Sales Complexity**: Corporate sales require relationships and customization
   - Mitigation: Start with B2C; add B2B later with proper sales team

2. **Retention Challenges**: Language learning apps have high churn (60-80%)
   - Mitigation: Focus on community, outcomes tracking, career integration

3. **Regulatory Risk**: IELTS/language requirement changes could affect demand

## 10. FINAL ASSESSMENT

### Market Opportunity: **MODERATE TO STRONG**
- TAM: ~200,000-220,000 annual skilled migrants needing workplace English
- Growing opportunity: International student cap increasing 2026 (lag effect)
- B2B opportunity: Untapped corporate training market

### Product-Market Fit: **LIKELY, WITH CAVEATS**
- Your audience exists and is engaged (28K TikTok followers)
- Content resonates (1.3M views on top video)
- BUT: Motivation may be different than assumed (confidence > career)

### Competitive Position: **STRONG**
- No direct competitor focused on Australian workplace English
- Gap in market for career-focused language learning
- Opportunity to differentiate on community and outcomes

### Business Viability: **UNCERTAIN**
- Pricing model needs validation ($15-35/month vs. $25-50/month)
- Retention model needs testing (language apps have high churn)
- B2B opportunity needs exploration (could be 50%+ of revenue)

### Recommendation: **PROCEED WITH CAUTION, VALIDATE ASSUMPTIONS FIRST**

Before scaling, you need to:
1. ✅ Validate that confidence/fitting in is stronger driver than career advancement
2. ✅ Validate that $25-35/month pricing is acceptable (not $25-50)
3. ✅ Validate B2B corporate training opportunity
4. ✅ Test retention and outcomes with beta users
5. ✅ Measure conversion from TikTok followers to paying customers

**If these validations succeed, you have a strong business opportunity. If they fail, you need to pivot on messaging, pricing, or positioning.**
