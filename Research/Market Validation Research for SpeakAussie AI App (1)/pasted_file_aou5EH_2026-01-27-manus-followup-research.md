# Follow-Up Research Brief: SpeakAussie Competitive Deep-Dive

## Context

This is a follow-up to the initial market validation research. We now need deeper competitive intelligence and user behavior research to inform product decisions.

**What we already know:**
- Primary audience: Skilled migrants 28-44, 65% in Australia
- Primary motivation: Confidence/belonging > career advancement (inverted from our assumption)
- Market size: ~200,000-220,000 annual TAM
- No direct competitor for Australian workplace English
- Recommended pricing: $15-35/month

**What we still need to know:**
- Why users abandon language learning apps (churn drivers)
- What users hate about existing apps (from reviews)
- What users wish existed (unmet needs)
- How much time users actually spend learning
- What format/session length works best
