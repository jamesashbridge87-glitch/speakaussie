2. **Practical Pain Points**: Migrants want practical solutions to real problems (accent, slang, interviews), not abstract career advice

3. **Multiple Barriers**: Pain points are interconnected - accent anxiety leads to reduced visibility, which leads to slower career progression

4. **Emotional Validation**: SpeakAussie's top content (1.3M views) validates that practical, confidence-building content resonates most

5. **Messaging Gap**: Current market messaging (career advancement) doesn't align with audience motivation (confidence and belonging)

### Recommendation

**Reframe SpeakAussie's value proposition from "career advancement" to "confidence and belonging"**, with career advancement as a secondary benefit.

This aligns with audience motivation and emotional drivers, which are more powerful than rational drivers.
