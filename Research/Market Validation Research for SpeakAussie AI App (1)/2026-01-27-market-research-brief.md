## IMPORTANT: RESEARCH FREEDOM

While we've outlined specific research areas below, we explicitly want you to:

### 1. CHALLENGE OUR ASSUMPTIONS
- We assume career advancement is the primary driver. You may find evidence it's something else entirely.
- We assume skilled migrants are the core audience. You may discover a bigger or better segment.
- We assume Australian-specific content is valuable. You may find people just want general business English.
- If your research contradicts our assumptions, that's valuable. Tell us.

### 2. EXPLORE ADJACENT OPPORTUNITIES
- Are there related markets we haven't considered? (e.g., Australian employers hiring overseas, Aussies learning to communicate with international colleagues, accent reduction for different purposes)
- Are there partnership or distribution channels we should know about?
- Are there emerging trends in language learning or migration that affect this market?

### 3. SURFACE UNEXPECTED FINDINGS
- If you discover something interesting that doesn't fit our framework, include it.
- Create a dedicated section for "Unexpected Insights" or "Things You Didn't Ask About But Should Know"

### 4. IDENTIFY RISKS AND REASONS THIS MIGHT FAIL
- What could kill this business?
- What are we potentially wrong about?
- What do competitors do well that would be hard to beat?

### 5. RECOMMEND WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE ASKED
- At the end, include a section: "Questions You Should Have Asked"
- What research gaps remain?
- What would you investigate next?

## Phase 1: Owned Audience Research (Highest Priority)

### 1.1 Follower Survey
Deploy a short survey (5-7 questions) to Instagram and TikTok audience via:
- Instagram Stories poll sequence
- Link in bio to Google Form/Typeform
- TikTok video CTA

Questions to include:
- Where are you in your Australia journey? (Planning to move / Just arrived / Been here 1-2 years / 3+ years)
- What's your current work situation? (Job hunting / New job / Established / Looking to advance)
- What's your biggest communication challenge at work? (Open text)
- Have you paid for English learning before? If so, what and how much?
- What would make you pay for an app like this? (Multiple choice + other)
- How much would you pay monthly? ($0 / $10 / $25 / $50+)

### 1.2 Comment Analysis
Export and analyze comments from top 20 performing TikTok and Instagram posts:
- Categorize by theme (pain points, questions, praise, requests)
- Extract exact language users use to describe problems
- Identify most-requested topics
- Note which videos generate "how do I..." or "I struggle with..." comments

### 1.3 DM/Message Review
Review direct messages received on both platforms:
- What questions do people ask?
- What help do they request?
- What situations do they describe?
- Any patterns by demographic or origin country?

### 1.4 Content Performance Deep-Dive
Analyze Instagram and TikTok analytics for:
- Saves (intent signal) vs. Likes (entertainment) ratio by content type
- Which topics drive profile visits and follows?
- Which content drives link clicks (if tracked)?
- Audience retention curves - where do people drop off?

## Phase 2: Market Sizing & Landscape

### 2.1 Immigration Data
Research Australian Department of Home Affairs data:
- Annual skilled migration intake (current and projected)
- Top source countries and growth trends
- Visa categories (482, 189, 190, etc.) and volumes
- International student numbers and post-study work visa conversions
- Flag any market dynamics we may have overlooked

### 2.2 Competitive Landscape
Map the competitive environment:

| Competitor Type | Examples | What They Offer | Gaps |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|------|
| General language | Duolingo, Babbel | Gamified courses | No Australian focus |
| Pronunciation | Elsa, Speechling | Accent coaching | No workplace context |
| Business English | Talaera, Preply | Corporate training | Expensive, not AU-specific |
| Australian slang | Various YouTube | Entertainment | No structured learning |
| IELTS prep | Magoosh, E2 | Test prep | Not workplace-focused |

Note any competitors we missed or emerging players.

### 2.3 App Store & Search Research
- Top keywords people search in App Store/Play Store for English learning
- Google search volume for "Australian English", "Aussie slang", "Australian accent" etc.
- SEO gaps and opportunities

### 2.4 Competitor Review Analysis
Mine 1-3 star reviews of Elsa, Duolingo, Babbel from:
- Australian users
- Users mentioning "work" or "professional"
- Users mentioning accent/pronunciation frustration

Extract: What's missing? What do they wish it had?

## Phase 3: Audience Deep-Dive

### 3.1 Pain Point Research
Qualitative research across platforms:

| Source | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|

| Facebook Groups | Australian migrant community groups - questions and complaints |
| LinkedIn | Posts from migrants about career challenges, imposter syndrome, communication barriers |
| Quora | Questions about Australian workplace culture and communication |

Include any pain points we didn't anticipate.

### 3.2 Segmentation by Origin Country
Top audience sources: India (4.5%), Indonesia (3.8%), Philippines, Vietnam, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh.

Research how needs differ:
- Indian English speakers: Already fluent, but accent/idiom gaps
- Southeast Asian speakers: Different baseline English levels
- East Asian speakers: Different grammar patterns, pronunciation challenges
- Any segments we overlooked

### 3.3 Trigger Event Mapping
Identify moments that create urgency:
- Job interview scheduled
- Performance review coming
- Passed over for promotion
- Embarrassing meeting incident
- Starting new role
- Assigned to lead a project

Research: Which triggers have highest conversion potential?

### 3.4 User Journey Mapping
When in their migration journey do people seek help?
- Pre-arrival (preparing)
- First 90 days (survival mode)
- 6-12 months (fitting in)
- 1-2 years (career growth)
- 3+ years (leadership aspirations)

---

## Phase 4: Willingness to Pay & Pricing

### 4.1 Existing Spend Research
- What do migrants currently spend on English improvement? (Apps, tutors, courses, IELTS prep)
- What's considered "worth it" vs. "waste of money"?
- Price anchors in the market (Elsa: $12/mo, Duolingo: $7/mo, Private tutor: $50-100/hr)

### 4.2 Value Perception
- What outcomes would justify $25/mo? $50/mo? $100/mo?
- Is career advancement a strong enough value prop to command premium pricing?
- Would people pay more for Australian-specific vs. general English?

### 4.3 B2B/Corporate Opportunity
- Do Australian companies sponsor English training for employees?
- Is there budget for this in onboarding or L&D?
- Who makes these purchasing decisions?
- What would a corporate offering look like?

### 4.4 Alternative Monetization
- Are there monetization models we should consider beyond subscriptions?
- One-time purchases, cohort courses, employer-sponsored, etc.?

- Common failure patterns (too hard, too easy, boring, no time, no progress)

### 5.3 Time & Commitment Reality
- How much time do working migrants actually have for learning?
- When do they learn? (Commute, lunch, evening, weekend)
- What format fits their life? (5-min micro-lessons vs. 30-min sessions)

---

## Phase 6: Employer Perspective

## Assumptions to Validate (or Disprove)

| Assumption | What Would Validate It | What Would Contradict It |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Primary audience is skilled migrants already in Australia, age 35-44 | Pain points align with working professionals, willingness to pay | Larger/more engaged segment exists elsewhere |
| Career advancement is the primary motivation | Users explicitly link English to promotions/salary | Social or other motivations dominate |
| Interview success is secondary motivation | Job seekers express this need | Not mentioned or low priority |
| Social belonging matters | Users express isolation/outsider feelings | Users don't care about social integration |
| Users would pay $25-50/month | Comparable spending on alternatives, stated willingness | Price resistance, lower benchmarks |
| Australian-specific content is uniquely valuable | Users express frustration with generic alternatives | General business English would suffice |
| Workplace scenarios are the right format | Users want situational practice | Users want something else (courses, tutoring, etc.) |

## Final Note

We'd rather learn we're wrong now than build the wrong thing. If research suggests we should pivot, change our audience, or rethink our approach entirely - tell us directly. The goal is truth, not validation of our existing beliefs.
