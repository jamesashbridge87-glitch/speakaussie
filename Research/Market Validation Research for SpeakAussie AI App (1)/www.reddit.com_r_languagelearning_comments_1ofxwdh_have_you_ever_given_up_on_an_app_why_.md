Have you ever given up on an app? Why?

I'm starting to lose motivation and consistency and I'm getting tired a bit. But at the same time I wanna keep that language fire in me . Life's getting busy unfortunately 🥲 trying to balance languages and school🥲🥲 . . Also can anyone tell me about the last time you felt really excited about learning another language Plus which tools do you use, and what do you wish they did better . .

Apps don't take you very far in any language, so not only should you expect to give up on them after a while, but you'll be doing yourself a disservice by not doing that.

I've given them all up honestly. I switched to textbooks, YouTube and lessons. I learn more and also have way more fun than I did with apps.

Yes, all of them. There are textbook and websites that do a better job at teaching the basics, and after that I can rely on learner content and native content.

I gave up on Duolingo when the relentless monetization and enshittification was undeniable, with energy, AI, etc. I'm still doing one lesson a day to keep the streak going to 666 which is when I will quit for real.

Maybe switch to a low effort learning method like watching TV in your target language?

I will be giving up on Duolingo after my subscription expires but I’ve still got a good 6 months left. Gives me enough time to finish the Korean course (almost done), work a bit more on Italian and by then they might have updated German to B2 which I only use as a refresher (I was previously B2 but that was years ago and I don’t actively use it much anymore just refresh occasionally). After my subscription’s over I’ll focus on textbooks/input/anki because I hate feeling like I’m not learning core grammar concepts 😩 I also really despise the AI characters especially in the listening exercises.

To get some spark back I would try listening/watching something in your target language and maybe making anki flash cards based off that?
