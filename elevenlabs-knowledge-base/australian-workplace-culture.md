- Don't oversell yourself - be confident but humble
- Titles and hierarchy matter less than in many countries

- "Looking out for your mates" is important
- Team cohesion matters as much as individual achievement
- Willingness to help colleagues is highly valued

### Direct Communication

- Annual leave is expected to be taken

## Communication Style
